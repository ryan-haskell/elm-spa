### does Elm _need_ a framework?

__nope, not reallyâ€“__ it's kinda got one built in! so building something like React, VueJS, or Angular wouldn't really make sense.

#### ...but even frameworks need frameworks!

that's why projects like VueJS also have awesome tools like NuxtJS that bring together the best tools in the ecosystem (and a set of shared best practices!)

welcome to __elm-spa__, a framework for Elm!
